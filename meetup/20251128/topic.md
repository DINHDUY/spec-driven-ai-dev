Design a web application for soccer training with the following functional requirements:
The user interface shall utilize a solid background color, either blue (initial color) or red.
Blue indicates the instruction to move to the left side of the cone.
Red indicates the instruction to move to the right side of the cone.
The application must allow the user to specify the frequency of color changes (i.e., the transition from red to blue or blue to red). The pop up dialog should appear one time when users open/refresh the page.
Show the pause state (like pausing a Youtube video) when the users press any keyboard, mouse click, or touching the screen. 
Show the help message when users type `h or ?`.
The web application must be responsive, detecting the screen size and ensuring compatibility with common devices, including desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets.
The architecture should favor static web pages to enhance portability.
A deployment mechanism should automatically publish the web page to a free web hosting service for demonstration purposes.
A detailed description of the web application's functionality is required.
Use git to keep track of change history and make the source code available via GitHub.
Add tests for all changes if possible.
(Optional) Say LEFT/RIGHT when switching the colors.
