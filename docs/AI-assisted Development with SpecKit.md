## The Problem: "Vibe Coding"

> "SpecKit aims to solve the problems of inconsistent, unpredictable, and hard-to maintain code often generated by vague, iterative prompts to an AI assistant."

## What is GitHub SpecKit?

- An **open-source toolkit** (MIT-licensed) and methodology from GitHub that formalizes **Spec Driven Development (SDD)**.
- Brings **structure and discipline** to AI-assisted development.
- Make specifications a **living, central, executable artifacts**.
- The AI assistant (like Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc…) uses this spec as its **single "source of truth"** to generate code.
- Bundles **templates, a CLI, prompts/commands**, and **agent-friendly workflows**.

---

## Key Goals & Features

### Solves "Vibe Coding"

Replace chaotic, ad-hoc prompting with a structured, gated workflow for predictable results.

### AI Agentic-Agnostic

Designed to work with various AI coding assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and more.

### Human-in-the-Loop

Enforce explicit checkpoints for a Human developer to review, refine, and approve all AI-generated artifacts.

---

## The Core Artifacts

### constitution.md (The "Rules")

Define the "non-negotiable" project principles. This includes coding standards, preferred frameworks, security requirements, and testing methodologies. The AI must adhere to this.

### spec.md (The "What")

Details the feature, user stories, goals, and edge cases. It focuses on what to build, not how to build it.

### plan.md (The "How")

An AI-generated technical implementation plan. Based on the spec and constitution, it outlines the architecture, data models, and file structures.

### tasks.md (The "Checklist")

A detailed, step-by-step checklist of small, testable, and verifiable tasks that the AI will follow to implement the plan.

---

## The Spec-Driven Workflow

1. **Define**: Teams first define a clear spec.
2. **Plan**: Derive a technical plan from that spec.
3. **Breakdown**: Break the plan into small, testable tasks.
4. **Execute**: Use code-generation agents to implement each task.
5. **Verify**: Agents verify the implementation of each task.

---

## The Goal & Value

- **Shifts away from**: Ad-hoc "vibe-coding."
- **Moves toward**: Reproducible and verifiable development using AI assistance.
- The project is actively maintained and supported by documentation and a public site.

---

## Core Components and Concepts

### Executable specifications

Specs are written as living artifacts that drive planning, implementation, and verification rather than being discarded after design.

### CLI and templates

A command-line toolkit plus project templates to scaffold spec-driven projects and agent interactions.

### AI agent integration

Recipes and prompts designed to work with multiple code-generation agents (Copilot, Claude, Gemini CLI, etc.) so tasks can be delegated reliably to AI assistants.

### Task decomposition and verifiability

The workflow emphasizes small, testable tasks and automated verification to reduce brittle, non-reproducible outputs from generative models.

### Community and docs

Official website and GitHub repo provide quick-start guides, examples, and agent recipes to adopt the pattern.

## How SpecKit Changes the Development Loop

1. **Specification first**: Capture intent, acceptance criteria, constraints, and nonfunctional requirements in a machine-readable spec.
2. **Plan generation**: Produce a concrete technical plan from the spec (architecture, interfaces, dependencies) so generated code aligns with intent.
3. **Tasking**: Split the plan into minimal tasks with clear inputs/outputs and tests so AI agents can implement each reliably.
4. **Implementation by agents**: Run agents against individual tasks using standardized prompts and the CLI to produce code and tests.
5. **Automated verification**: Run the generated tests and integration checks; failed tasks are iterated until they pass, creating a verifiable history from spec to working code.

## Starting a New (Greenfield) Project

1. Step 1: Installation and Initialization
2. Step 2: Define the Constitution
3. Step 3: Specify the Feature
4. Step 4: Review and Clarify the Spec
5. Step 5: Generate the Technical Plan
6. Step 6: Review the Plan
7. Step 7: Generate Tasks
8. Step 8: Implement the Tasks
9. Step 9: Test and Review

---

### Step 1: Installation and Initialization

First, you must install the SpecKit CLI (often via a tool like `uv`). You then initialize your project.

1. **Install SpecKit**:

   ```bash
   uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   ```

2. **Initialize Project**:
   - `.github/` for agent prompts
   - `.specify/` for specs) and the core artifact files

---

### Step 2: Define the Constitution

Before you build anything, you set the rules.

1. Navigate to the generated `/memory/constitution.md` file.
2. Edit this file to define your project's standards. This is your one-time setup to guide all future AI work.
   - Example: "All new API endpoints must include unit tests." or "Use React with TypeScript for all front-end components."
3. You can also use an AI command like `/speckit.constitution` to help you draft these principles.

---

### Step 3: Specify the Feature

Now, you define your first feature, focusing on **what** it is, not **how** it's built.

1. In your AI assistant, use the specify command: `/speckit.specify`
2. Provide a high-level prompt describing your feature.
   - Example: `/speckit.specify Build a user authentication system that allows users to sign up with an email and password and log in.`
3. The AI will generate a detailed `spec.md` file, including user stories, acceptance criteria, and a "Needs Clarification" section.

---

### Step 4: Review and Clarify the Spec

This is a critical **human-in-the-loop** step.

1. Open the newly created `spec.md` file.
2. Manually review the AI's interpretation of your feature. Pay close attention to the "Needs Clarification" or "Edge Cases" sections.
3. Use the `/speckit.clarify` command or simply chat with your AI to answer these questions and refine the spec until it's accurate and complete.

---

### Step 5: Generate the Technical Plan

Once the "what" is locked, you generate the "how."

- In your AI assistant, use the plan command: `/speckit.plan`
- The AI will read the `constitution.md` and the approved `spec.md`.
- It will generate a `plan.md` file, which includes the proposed architecture, data models, API endpoints, and a list of files to be created or modified.

---

### Step 6: Review the Plan

You must review the AI's technical proposal.

1. Open `plan.md` and any related files (e.g., `data-model.md`).
2. Verify that the technical approach aligns with your constitution and best practices.
3. Request changes from the AI until you approve the plan.

---

### Step 7: Generate Tasks

Break the plan into small, actionable steps.

1. In your AI assistant, use the tasks command: `/speckit.tasks`
2. The AI will read the `plan.md` and generate a `tasks.md` file, which is a detailed checklist.
   - Example:
     - "1. Create file `src/models/user.js`..."
     - "2. Add email and passwordHash fields to User schema..."

---

### Step 8: Implement the Tasks

This is where the AI writes the code.

- In your AI assistant, use the implement command: `/speckit.implement`
- The AI will now execute every task from `tasks.md` one by one, writing and saving the code to your file system.
- Your role is to monitor the process, answer any questions the AI has, and intervene if it gets stuck.

---

### Step 9: Test and Review

Once implementation is complete, you review the final output, run tests, and merge the code.

## Adding a New Feature (Brownfield) Project

1. Step 1: Installation and Initialization
2. Step 2: Start a New Feature Branch
3. Step 3: Specify the New Feature
4. Step 4: Review and Clarify the Spec
5. Step 5: Generate the Plan
6. Step 6: Review the Plan
7. Step 7: Generate Tasks
8. Step 8: Implement the Tasks
9. Step 9: Test and Merge

---

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Keep tasks small** and strictly **testable** to minimize agent hallucination and increase verifiability.
- **Provide rich, precise context** to agents: relevant files, small code excerpts, and test harness snippets reduce churn.
- **Treat generated code as reviewable artifacts**: Combine automated tests with human review for design and security decisions.
- **Maintain traceability**: Link tasks, commits, and PRs to spec IDs so the spec is the source of truth for why changes exist.

---

## Known Limitations and Considerations

- AI agents can still produce **incorrect** or **insecure** code; the approach **reduces** but does **not eliminate** the need for expert review and security scanning.
- **Adoption requires cultural shift**: Teams must invest in authoring high-quality specs and in CI that enforces verification for each generated task.
- **Tooling maturity and integrations vary** by agent and language; check the SpecKit repo for current supported workflows and community-contributed adapters.
